## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Note: Start with the backend setup first for a streamline setup process

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
````

### 2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

> This runs the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> Make sure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5050` or change the `baseURL` in `src/api.js`.

## üß™ API Expectations

This frontend expects a backend with the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint     | Description      |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| GET    | `/todos`     | Get all to-dos   |
| POST   | `/todos`     | Create new to-do |
| PUT    | `/todos/:id` | Update a to-do   |
| DELETE | `/todos/:id` | Delete a to-do   |

To test with the provided Flask backend, see the [`backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Dependency Vulnerabilities

This project may show a small number of vulnerabilities when running:

```bash
npm audit
```

These come from indirect dependencies (primarily in the React + Tailwind toolchain). Attempting to auto-fix them using `npm audit fix --force` caused breaking changes to `react-scripts` and Tailwind integration.

For this reason, and to preserve a fully working and testable demo, known vulnerabilities were not force-fixed.

‚úÖ **If this project were going to production**, I would:

* Replace `react-scripts` with a custom Vite/Webpack setup
* Lock and verify all dependencies with `npm audit`
* Ensure CI and automated tests cover regressions
