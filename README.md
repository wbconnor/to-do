# ✅ Full-Stack To-Do List App

This project is a full-stack to-do list application that lets users add, edit, complete, delete, search, and sort tasks — all from a clean, responsive UI powered by a modern tech stack:

- 🧠 **Python + Flask** (backend API)
- ⚛️ **React** (frontend UI)
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## 💬 About the Project

This app was built as part of a take-home coding exercise — but it became much more than that. I wanted to create a **thoughtful UI/UX** and clean architecture with professional-level polish.

I partnered with ChatGPT as a technical assistant throughout the process, using it to:

- Validate implementation plans
- Handle API design and hooks
- Discuss tradeoffs (e.g. debouncing edits, edit mode toggling)
- Review and revise component structure
- Suggest styling improvements with Tailwind

The result is a solution I feel genuinely proud of — not just functional, but elegant and adaptable.

## 🧭 Start Here

- Want to run the **API**? → Go to [`backend/readme.md`](./backend/readme.md)
- Want to run the **UI**? → Go to [`frontend/readme.md`](./frontend/readme.md)

Each directory has clear setup instructions and details specific to that layer of the stack.

## 🧠 Tech Highlights

- Functional React with custom hooks
- Debounced inline editing
- Tailwind-powered layout and responsive styles
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible, readable, and (hopefully) reviewer-friendly
